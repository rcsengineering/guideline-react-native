## Basic Guidelines for React Native Development

üëã Welcome to a repository containing my _opinionated_ guidelines for **React Native mobile app development**.

> _Please use responsibly, and only as directed. Side-effects may include robust and reliable code, maintainability, readability, and slight finger-fatigue from verbose annotations._ üòÅ

- Many decisions made in terms of versions of libraries used, configuration settings, etc... are based upon a real-world production project.

See the [`app`](./app/) directory for the React Native project (this is the root of the project)

See the [`docs`](./docs/) directory for markdown based documentation detailing the architecture and coding conventions used.
